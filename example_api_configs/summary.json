The benchmark palm oil contract <FCPOc3> for February delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange gained 90 ringgit, or 1.94%, to 4,732 ringgit ($1,062.89) a metric ton during the midday break. The Malaysian palm oil futures opened higher following recoveries seen in rival oils during Asian trading hours, said Anilkumar Bagani, research head at Sunvin Group. The almost certain increase in Indonesia's palm oil export taxes and levies in December 2024 has also boosted a chance of rebound in the Malaysian palm oil futures, he said. Bagani said he expected Indonesia's palm oil reference price for December to increase to $1073.56 per ton. Indonesia's crude palm oil reference price for November is currently set at $961.97 per ton and its export tax at $124 per ton. Dalian's most-active soyoil contract <DBYcv1> fell 0.12%, while its palm oil contract <DCPcv1> added 0.6%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade <BOcv1> were up 0.79%. Palm oil tracks price movements of rival edible oils, as they compete for a share of the global vegetable oils market. Oil prices retreated following 6% gains last week, but remained near two-week highs as geopolitical tensions grew between Western powers and major oil producers Russia and Iran, raising risks of supply disruption. Brent crude futures <LCOc1> for January were down 0.51% at $74.80 a barrel as of 0457 GMT. Weaker crude oil futures make palm a less attractive option for biodiesel feedstock. The ringgit <MYR=>, palm's currency of trade, strengthened 0.29% against the dollar, making the commodity more expensive for buyers holding foreign currencies. Cargo surveyors are scheduled to release their export data for Nov. 1-25 later in the day. Palm oil may test support at 4,595 ringgit per metric ton, with a good chance of breaking below it and falling towards 4,510 ringgit, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.
