*Price is delivering to a premium previous session

$ETH - New ATH This Year! But it takes time (as usual), {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': '', 'value': '$ETH - New ATH This Year! But it takes time (as usual)'}, [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSDT/UcgeyUum-ETH-New-ATH-This-Year-But-it-takes-time-as-usual/'}], https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSDT/UcgeyUum-ETH-New-ATH-This-Year-But-it-takes-time-as-usual/, I tend to believe the patience pays off 

A sharp growth of almost X2 earlier this year granted #Ethereum an opportunity to take hold above  major  support levels and  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  gladly took this chance. Now the price is staying above the  $2100 - $2400 support zone. 

If you are looking for a safe way to  X2 your capital  this year, you should definitely consider buying Ethereum in this price range.

 In fact, there are two possible options of further price movements: 
 
   Orange path   (~33%) : light touch of the support zone, followed by a sharp pump upwards towards the $3200 resistance by the month of August 2025. Then some consolidation there and continuation with the coming of Autumn  (traditionally bullish season for crypto) . 
   Red path   (~66%) : a full-fledged dive in the support zone, down to $2150  (shadows can even reach $1950ish zone) . It will take more time, but allow people to build more proper positions, if they have not done so already. This dive can also help in gathering liquidity  (from liquidating early LONGs with high leverage, everything with lev. higher than x6 will be washed down)  that will later be used for pushing the price  higher . 
 
As you could understand,  I'd prefer the second option , but those who know Ethereum erratic behaviour they just... know. I will start accumulating  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  once it reaches $2450 and will continue doing it down to $2100 using x5 leverage  (if such price will ever be achieved) . 

 Target is $4500 - $5000. Being realistic here., {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': '', 'value': "I tend to believe the patience pays off \n\nA sharp growth of almost X2 earlier this year granted #Ethereum an opportunity to take hold above  major  support levels and  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  gladly took this chance.

* **Symbol**: CRYPTOCAP\:TOTAL3 / CRYPTOCAP\:BTC.D
* **Timeframe**: Weekly (1W), 
* **Purpose**: A clean, data-driven proxy for detecting altseason momentum



 Technical Structure: 

✅ Key Support Zones

* **13.47B (61.8% Fib)**: Critical golden zone; current price consolidation area
* **12.45B (50.0% Fib)**: Lower bound of golden zone
* **11.00B**: Historical support zone
* **8.15B (0.0%)**: Absolute bottom of retracement range


🔹 Hidden Bullish Divergence

* **MACD Histogram & Signal Lines** show hidden bullish divergence
* Price action forming **higher lows** while MACD makes **lower lows**
* Indicates trend continuation potential


 🔢 Fibonacci Targets

TP1: 16.8B (100.0%)
TP2: 22.2B (161.8%)
TP3: 30.7B (261.8%)


🔄 Expected Path

* Potential short-term correction toward 12.4B followed by a breakout
* Bullish continuation path sketched with progressive Fib targets




📈  Macro & Fundamental Confluence 

📉 Liquidity and Monetary Easing

* Global monetary policy is easing (e.g., Fed pivot expected mid-2025)
* Increased liquidity historically precedes strong altcoin rallies

 BTC Dominance Decline 

* BTC.D rolling down from long-term highs
* Signals beginning of capital rotation into altcoins

 🚀 Emerging Narratives

* Rise of L2s (e.g., Base, zkSync), AI tokens, real-world asset protocols
* Fresh narratives tend to amplify altseason rotations

💼 Institutional Tailwinds

* Spot ETH ETF approvals pave way for alt ETF flows
* Regulatory clarity expected to reduce uncertainty in late 2025

🌐 TOTAL3 (Altcoin Market Cap Excluding BTC & ETH)

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL3/JnL7bens-TOTAL3-Altcoin-Market-Cap-Excluding-BTC-ETH-Weekly-TF-2025/

📊 BTC Dominance (BTC.D)

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTC.D/wQ1phX3J-BTC-D-Dominance-at-Critical-Fibonacci-Confluence-2025-Weekly/

These charts offer standalone confirmation of:

Altcoin strength forming on TOTAL3

BTC dominance facing structural resistance




  Composite Altseason Thesis: 

1. Liquidity injections + halving = BTC rally
2. BTC.D breakdown + TOTAL3 support = altcoin strength
3. Technical confirmations: hidden divergence, fib confluence
4. Narrative and regulatory catalysts = widespread rotation



 **Conclusion**:  
We are entering a prime zone for altseason acceleration. Price reclaim above 13.47B and continued BTC.D drop will validate bullish thesis. Monitor closely for breakouts past TP1 and momentum into TP2/TP3.




📌 Current status:
- Price rebounding in the 12.45–13.47B Fibonacci zone (50–61.8%)
- Hidden bullish divergence on MACD + ascending price structure
- BTC.D has rolled off 65% resistance — suggesting capital rotation

📊 Altseason Thesis:
1. Post-halving BTC rally → profit dispersion into altcoins
2. Macro conditions (Fed pivot, record liquidity) enabling risk-on environment
3. Technical confirmation via index momentum and fib structure
4. Narrative tailwinds: Layer-2 adoption, AI-crypto, altcoin ETF catalysts

📈 Targets:
- TP1 @ 16.8B (100% Fib)
- TP2 @ 22.2B (161.8% Fib)
- TP3 @ 30.7B (261.8% Fib)

Take a look at our analysis for NAS100.

Time Frame: 9h
Current Trend: Bearish
Sentiment: Overbought (based on 7-period RSI) 
Forecast: Bearish

The market is on a crucial zone of supply 21,771.1.

The above-mentioned technicals clearly indicate the dominance of sellers on the market. I recommend shorting the instrument, aiming at 20,767.2 level.

P.S
Please, note that an oversold/overbought condition can last for a long time, and therefore being oversold/overbought doesn't mean a price rally will come soon, or at all.

Please, check our technical outlook for USDJPY.

Time Frame: 4h
Current Trend: Bullish
Sentiment: Oversold (based on 7-period RSI) 
Forecast: Bullish

The price is testing a key support 144.863.

Current market trend & oversold RSI makes me think that buyers will push the price. I will anticipate a bullish movement at least to 146.013 level.

P.S
The term oversold refers to a condition where an asset has traded lower in price and has the potential for a price bounce.

Overbought refers to market scenarios where the instrument is traded considerably higher than its fair value. Overvaluation is caused by market sentiments when there is positive news.

Current Market Context (June 8, 2025)
Price: 165.018 (Closing)

Daily Change: +0.12% (Mild bullish momentum)

Key Levels:

Resistance: 165.277 (Daily High), 166.000 (Psychological), 167.000 (Upper Range)

Support: 164.741 (Daily Low), 164.000 (Critical), 162.000 (Strong Demand Zone)

Scenario 1: BUY (Long Trade)
Trigger:

Price holds above 164.741 (Daily Low) and bounces with rising volume.

Break above 165.277 (Daily High) confirms bullish continuation.

Targets:

166.000 (Psychological Resistance)

167.000 (Upper Range)

Stop-Loss: Below 164.000 (Invalidation Level)

Rationale:

Bullish momentum from the daily close (+0.12%).

Higher lows suggest buyer interest near 164.000–164.741.

Scenario 2: SELL (Short Trade)
Trigger:

Price breaks below 164.741 (Daily Low) with increased selling volume.

Rejection from 165.277 (Daily High) signals weakness.

Targets:

Accurately grasp the gold trend analysis next week, {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': '', 'value': 'Accurately grasp the gold trend analysis next week'}, [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/obkQ6si7-Accurately-grasp-the-gold-trend-analysis-next-week/'}], https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/obkQ6si7-Accurately-grasp-the-gold-trend-analysis-next-week/, 📰 Impact of news:

1. The geopolitical situation is gradually deteriorating
2. Trump again calls on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates

📈 Market analysis:

The current weekly moving average support for gold prices is roughly 3250-3260. If 3250-60 can be maintained, then gold may continue to maintain consolidation and wait for an opportunity to choose a trend. If it falls below 3250, then it can directly see the 3200 mark. If 3200 falls below again, then it will see 3100. In the short term, the first focus of the gold price below is 3315. As long as it stays above 3315, gold is still in a bullish trend. Secondly, pay attention to the 3280 line below. If it falls below 3280, the gold price will further test the support of 3260-3250. It is possible that gold will form a head and shoulders top structure on the daily chart next week. It may fall to 3250-60 at the beginning of the week to lure shorts into the market, and then stretch and rebound to around 3350 to form a shoulder position, and finally directly dive down to around 3150.

The U.S. and China are set to hold official trade talks in London on June 9, and the market is already shifting in anticipation.

This video breaks down exactly how the process works — from Trump’s surprise phone call, to tariff de-escalation, to what happens when global tensions ease.

If you're planning to short USD/JPY, USD/CHF, or any safe-haven pairs next week, you need to watch this first.
Because a positive trade outcome = risk-on sentiment, and that means JPY and CHF will likely weaken fast.

I explain:

Why optimism crushes safe-haven setups

What smart money is watching

How to align your trades with the macro narrative

And how not to get trapped like most retail traders will

 Technical Overview – Summary Points 
__________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Momentum : Bullish structure on 1D/12H (MTFTI “Up”), but short-term consolidation (1H-2H “Down”). Momentum exhaustion observed.
 Key Supports/Resistances : Resistances: 105287.8 / 106743.9 / 109952.8 / 111949. Supports: 103033.3 / 100333.3 / 93337.4. Repeated rejections below 105-106k, active testing of 103-100k supports.
 Volume : Normal or slightly elevated on all timeframes. No capitulation or euphoric extremes detected.
 Multi-TF Behaviour : Strong sector leadership (Risk On / Risk Off Indicator = “Strong Buy” across all frames; growth stocks > market). No behavioural anomalies on ISPD DIV. High-cycle consolidation below resistance.
 

__________________________________________________________________________________

 Strategic Summary 
__________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Overall Bias : Neutral/bullish as long as 103k/100k holds. Bullish momentum intact, but short-term caution warranted.
 Opportunities : Defensive buys/technical pullbacks above 103k; scalp/range trading 103-106k.
 Risk Zones : Confirmed breakdown below 100k or acceleration in LTH distribution.
 Macro Catalysts : Next FOMC June 17-18; no major short-term events identified (recent neutral macro, FOMC is key for swings).
 Action Plan : Prioritize strict stops (≥3%) near pivots, consistent monitoring of behaviour/volume. Avoid overexposure pre-FOMC.
 

__________________________________________________________________________________

 Multi-Timeframe Analysis 
__________________________________________________________________________________
 
 1D : Structuring range below 109952.8-111949 resistances. Bullish HTF trend, but momentum pausing. Average volume. Risk On / Risk Off Indicator “Strong Buy”. No extreme ISPD signals (neutral).
 12H – 6H : Consolidation; supports holding, no euphoric confirmation (normal volumes, ISPD DIV neutral). Sector leadership unchanged.
 4H : Compression below 105287.8. Moderate volume. Defensive resumption on supports. MTFTI bullish. Dynamic risk: monitor for sell-side capitulation.
 2H – 1H : Technical correction, active retest of 105k (range 103-105k). Absorption volume. MTFTI “Down”.
 30min – 15min : Short-term positive bias above 103k. Risk of false break if volume remains low. Risk On / Risk Off Indicator “Buy”/“Strong Buy”.
 Cross-Indicators : Market leadership confirmed: Risk On / Risk Off Indicator = Strong Buy on all frames >15min. No excess behaviour or significant divergences detected. Key ranges: 103k-105k. On-chain: heavy LTH profit-taking but no panic.
 Summary : BTC market in post-cycle-high congestion phase, structurally robust, but momentum recalibrating with fewer “easy trades.”
 

__________________________________________________________________________________

 Cross insights & on-chain summary 
__________________________________________________________________________________
 
 On-chain (Glassnode) : Top at $111.8k, correction to $103.2k by LTH profit-taking. Spot accumulation on $103.7k/$95.6k. Upside limited unless fresh buying flows return.
 Macro events : Awaiting FOMC; no recent surprises. Price action and levels dominate short-term strategy.
 Stops/invalidation : Swing long defended at 103k/100k (stop <100k H4). Partial short/sell below 106743.9/109952.8. Dynamic targets: 106-109.9k; extension: 111.8k if breakout on volume.
 

__________________________________________________________________________________

 Conclusion & Actionable Plan 
__________________________________________________________________________________

 Market condition: 
- High consolidation, ranging below major resistances.
- Long-term bullish, short-term momentum fading.
- Neutral/bullish if 100-103k holds.
- “No macro — only levels” until FOMC or volatility catalyst.

 Tactical decision: 
- Trade technically, stops ≥3% under supports.
- Defended buys at 103k (stop <100k), partial profit 106-109k.
- Continuous monitoring of volume/on-chain zone reaction.
- Aggressive exit/hedge below support, target 96k/83k.

SOLUSDT | The Final Liquidity Hunt | $250 is the Next Stop, {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': '', 'value': 'SOLUSDT | The Final Liquidity Hunt | $250 is the Next Stop'}, [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SOLUSDT/pmCFVq8N-SOLUSDT-The-Final-Liquidity-Hunt-250-is-the-Next-Stop/'}], https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SOLUSDT/pmCFVq8N-SOLUSDT-The-Final-Liquidity-Hunt-250-is-the-Next-Stop/, SOLUSDT is currently in an uptrend after recently breaking out of its extended downtrend to $95 which took out millions of long positions. Now, we are seeing yet another extended downtrend on the lower time frame, but the overall direction is still up.

Last week, price action printed two very bullish pinbars at the $155 level which could have been considered support, where price was consolidating around late April. High leverage traders entered here and eventually got liquidated last Friday.

Following the liquidity hunt, price reversed quickly, but not strong enough to reclaim the $155 zone. Many of those who were liquidated likely re-entered on this fast move, thinking that the liquidity hunt is over and price cannot move lower.

I am anticipating one FINAL move down to $140 before the uptrend resumes. This will be the move that takes out the dumb money and where smart money will take their positions. The alternative is that the liquidity hunt never happens, and price breaks out of the falling wedge to resume its uptrend.

 What about macro and micro factors? 

⚖️ Ripple vs SEC Case
On 8th May, both parties agreed to settle, which ignited a massive market-wide rally. Unfortunately, their filings were rejected due to a procedural issue. The next deadline for refiling is on 16th June. Once accepted, we can expect another massive rally.

🤝 US-China Trade Talks
This week, US and China will meet at the negotiation table again. On 12th May, US & China reached a deal in Geneva and sent markets on another rally. IF (big if) they come to another deal this time, we can expect another rally.

✂️ Fed Rate Cut Expectations
The Fed talked about cutting interest rates in late 2025. They are currently in a "wait and see" stance however, due to uncertainties. Eventually we will see a rate cut, and I believe this would be a "buy the rumor, sell the news" event. Markets will price in the anticipated rate cut before it happens later this year.

Stop Loss	26628
Risk	2812
Reward	10648
Target	40088
Risk:Reward	3.8
Last High	36366
Last Low	25718

✅ Trade Strength Highlights
Strong Confluence of Demand Zones across all timeframes (HTF, MTF, ITF), confirming bullish bias.

Entry (29440) is well-positioned at a fresh Weekly RBR Demand Zone, indicating low institutional resistance at that level.

Stop Loss (26628) aligns with Half-Yearly Demand Distal, offering safety below key institutional zone.

RR of 3.8 exceeds the standard 2.0 benchmark, making this a high-quality trade setup.

Target (40088) is 10K+ points away, leveraging trend continuation and minimal supply interference up to recent high (36366).

🛡️ Risk Management Notes
Use partial profit booking strategy at or near 36366 (Last High).

Shift SL to breakeven after crossing ~30500–31000 to protect gains.

Monitor macro news/events that could impact industrials or mid-large caps.

Psychological Levels: 43,000 (resistance) and 42,000 (support).

Overall Trend:

The price is trading in a range between 42,150.1 and 43,324.1, with slight recent downward pressure.

Moving averages or other indicators are not visible on this chart, but the volume (63.24K) appears moderate.

Possible Scenarios:
Buy (Long):

If the price bounces from support at 42,532.9 or 42,150.1 with increasing volume, a rebound toward 43,000 is possible.

A breakout above 42,888.0 (daily high) could confirm bullish momentum.

Sell (Short):

If the price breaks below 42,150.1, it could open the door to 41,000.0 (major support).

The weak daily performance (-0.23%) and failure to sustain gains might indicate temporary weakness.

Recommendation:
Wait for Confirmation:

For a buy, watch for a bounce from the mentioned support levels with rising volume.

For a sell, wait for a clear breakdown below 42,150.1.

Risk Management: Place a stop-loss below 42,000 for a buy or above 43,000 for a sell.

Note: Without additional technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.), this analysis is based on visible price levels. Use other tools to refine your strategy.

📌 Prioritize trades aligned with the overall trend (currently neutral to slightly bearish on this timeframe).

Please see our updated 1h chart levels and targets for the coming week.

We are seeing price play between two weighted levels with a gap above at 3318 and a gap below at 3281. We will need to see ema5 cross and lock on either weighted level to determine the next range.

We will see levels tested side by side until one of the weighted levels break and lock to confirm direction for the next range.

We will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch bounces up.

We will continue to buy dips using our support levels taking 20 to 40 pips. As stated before each of our level structures give 20 to 40 pip bounces, which is enough for a nice entry and exit. If you back test the levels we shared every week for the past 24 months, you can see how effectively they were used to trade with or against short/mid term swings and trends.

The swing range give bigger bounces then our weighted levels that's the difference between weighted levels and swing ranges.

EUR/USD is showing signs of weakness after rejecting the resistance zone around 1.1475 (Fib 0.618 level). The pair broke below the ascending trendline, suggesting that bullish momentum is fading.

🔻 Scenario:
We may see a corrective pullback to retest the broken trendline (around 1.1450–1.1460). If this retest holds as resistance, the pair is likely to continue its decline.

🎯 Bearish Targets:

First target: 1.1303

Second target zone: 1.1253 – 1.1220

📌 Invalidation Level: A daily close above 1.1577 would invalidate this bearish scenario.

RSI is also turning lower from mid-levels, supporting a potential downside move.
⚠️ Trade with proper risk management and monitor price action around the key levels.

Following up on our previous analysis, price action has continued to respect our Goldturn channel beautifully. After the strong move to 3272, we saw another push toward the channel top near 3433. However, just before completing the move, price was met with another sharp rejection, highlighting the strength of the range and the precision of our channel levels.

The key takeaway here is that 3272 is still providing solid support, and the price remains well contained within our defined range between 3272 and 3433. This reaffirms our strategy of buying dips near the lower end of the range rather than chasing strength near the top.

We remain focused on trading within this range, using our weighted Goldturns to guide entries on the lower timeframes (1H and 4H). As long as the structure holds, we’ll continue to target quick 30–40 pip intraday moves while positioning ourselves for a potential breakout scenario when the time is right.

This is the beauty of our Goldturn channels, drawn using weighted averages instead of pure price action. This unique approach helps us clearly identify fake outs and real breakouts, cutting out much of the noise that usually confuses traders.

Keep an eye on how price behaves around 3272 and 3433. A clean break and close above the channel top would be significant but until then, range play remains our primary game plan.

Let’s stay patient and disciplined.

Following up on last week’s chart update, we saw another perfect test of the channel top, right in line with our Goldturn Channel expectations. The new weekly candle completed the channel top challenge with precision, once again confirming the strength of our resistance levels.

As anticipated, the rejection came in cleanly, followed by a correction into EMA5 detachment, which halted just short of the 3281 level, a crucial axis we've been tracking for multiple weeks. This level continues to act as firm support, holding price within an evolving range.

We’re now seeing price action contained between 3281 and 3387, with potential for expansion higher as the ascending channel continues to rise. This expanding structure offers more room for strategic positioning, especially as price coils tighter within the upper band.

The 3387 gap remains active and is an obvious magnet if momentum builds. As long as we stay above the half line and especially above 3281, we remain in buy the dip mode, favouring long setups off our intraday Goldturns for quick 20 40 pip scalps or swing entries when conditions align.

Should we see a deeper pullback or close below 3281, we’ll reassess potential movement toward the lower channel boundary. Until then, the structure remains bullish within the channel.

The Goldturn methodology continues to prove its worth, cutting through noise and keeping us aligned with the real structure of the market.

Stay sharp, stay patient.
