https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, ETH New Update (4H), https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSDT/aVX2SfhO-ETH-New-Update-4H/, After being rejected from the higher levels and losing the trigger line, Ethereum now appears to have pulled back into the range zone and the trigger line.

It is expected that the price will be rejected once again from the red zone to the downside, and then turn bullish again from one of the two green zones and move upward.

This is our current outlook on Ethereum. The analysis will be updated accordingly.

Keep in mind that taking short positions in these zones is not low-risk either!

is going down.
I was trying to learn how to buy gold and silver.

So i thought i try to trade it on
the weekly chart.Even though on this chart  OANDA:AUDCAD  
the daily chart for this forex pair looks

like its in an over sold zone.But if you flip
this chart to a weekly chart
you will see an over bought zone.

The overbought zone will appear on 
the William.If i had the full professional 
tradingview membership

I would have shown you 2 time frames back to back.
This would have been on a split chart layout.

But since i only have a free version i can 
only show you how a bearish divergence looks

On the daily chart.If i had the professional membership
i would have shown you 2 layouts.
So what you need to do is the following:

 
 1-Open the layout.
 2-Put daily chart on left
 3-Put weekly chart on right
 4-Use the rocket booster strategy
 5-Use the william% indicator
 

Have you notice the bearish divergence?

its overbought on the week  
and the oversold  
on the day chart

This is a powerful strategy and my hope is
that it will serve you well.

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, JSTUSDT Forming Bullish Wave, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/JSTUSDT/jDPcmcjR-JSTUSDT-Forming-Bullish-Wave/, JSTUSDT is exhibiting a classic bullish wave pattern, signaling the potential for a trend reversal and a significant upward price movement. Recent price action suggests a solid base has been formed, with higher lows indicating growing buying pressure. As volume picks up, this adds weight to the bullish setup, and momentum indicators are aligning with a possible breakout. Traders and investors are beginning to take interest in JST due to both its technical positioning and the increasing engagement around the Just Network ecosystem.

Just (JST), a DeFi platform built on the TRON network, continues to gain traction for its lending, stablecoin, and yield farming features. This utility, combined with its integration across various TRON-based applications, has helped the project build a consistent user base. As DeFi projects regain attention in the broader crypto market, JST stands out with its established infrastructure and increasing usage metrics. These fundamentals support the potential for a 30% to 40% gain in the near term, especially if market sentiment stays bullish.

Technically, JSTUSDT is moving within a bullish wave formation, suggesting impulsive buying followed by controlled retracements. This pattern typically leads to further upward movement, particularly when supported by increasing trading volume. If price manages to break key resistance levels and hold above them, the next targets could be quickly achieved, offering traders attractive risk-reward opportunities.

In conclusion, JSTUSDT is setting up for a potential rally driven by a combination of bullish technicals and strong project fundamentals. As the DeFi narrative strengthens again, JST could see renewed momentum, especially if broader market conditions remain favorable. Keeping an eye on volume surges and breakout confirmations could offer timely entries for both short-term and mid-term strategies.

This week, the gold price broke through the head and shoulders bottom pattern and stopped at around $3,400
Following the sharp drop last Friday, the gold price trend showed a wide range of fluctuations, superimposed on the M chart resonance downward.
It is expected that the gold price will continue to fall on Monday.

1: On Monday this week, the gold price effectively broke through the blue macro triangle oscillation and went out of a new wave of pull-ups, but it was not until the highest point on Thursday that it effectively stood above the $3,400 mark. The downward trend after the release of non-agricultural data on Friday shows that the recent gold price is purely driven by policy and news.

2: The gold price has currently fallen below the central oscillation range of 3,340, and continues to fall and stop loss above 3,300. From this we draw the following conclusions:

A: As long as the gold price is below $3,340, the gold trading strategy should try to adopt a high-level short-selling strategy, with a stop loss set at 3,345-3,350.

B: 3,300-3,310 is the current effective support area. After fully testing the stability of the support level, you can consider trying to chase the short after the rebound high.

C: Key support level: 3200-3220-3250-3270-3300

D: Key pressure level: 3400-3340

Expected target for gold price decline on Monday: 3275-3250, 2025-06-08 06:04:02+00:00, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/mVBbgPTx-As-shown-in-the-figure-30-minute-cycle-chart/,

A rejection from the red zone toward the green zone could lead to a drop.

A candle close above the invalidation level would invalidate this analysis.

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, GOLD → Correction to 3275, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/R3egUday-GOLD-Correction-to-3275/, FX:XAUUSD  and medium-term outlook: Friday's strong unemployment data strengthened the dollar and triggered a sell-off in gold. Money is temporarily flowing out of the metal and into currencies and the stock market...

 https://www.tradingview.com/x/5BZrkQIQ/ 

Technically, gold is still in a bullish phase on the global timeframe. Logically, the situation is more reminiscent of a countertrend correction of the zone of interest before continuing growth. 
Despite the rise in the DXY after Friday's news, the dollar is still under pressure from Trump, who is pushing for an early interest rate cut. This move could significantly shake the market (dollar down, gold up)

Locally, on the hourly XAUUSD timeframe, we can clearly see how the price is breaking out of the uptrend, thereby triggering a downward impulse. 

 Resistance levels: 3325, 3343
Support levels: 3303, 3275 

The liquidity level of 3300 could act as a magnet for the price, from which a correction to the resistance of the range of 3325 could form (liquidity hunt), but due to the change in the fundamental background, gold may continue its correction to 3275 (support zone) before a possible continuation of growth.

The daily chart shows a strong bullish continuation from the 17,350 area, with price now extending toward the 22,000 USD zone.
We are currently within a weekly/monthly supply, with:
Mild RSI divergence in overbought conditions
Temporary rejection at 22,050–22,200
A potential liquidity sweep above highs before distribution or pullback
The monthly structure shows a strong swing low that may serve as anchor for a future reversal

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, CFXUSDT Forming Falling Wedge, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CFXUSDT/ghj0qn3T-CFXUSDT-Forming-Falling-Wedge/, CFXUSDT is showing signs of a strong bullish continuation as it emerges from a falling wedge pattern — a setup often considered a reliable reversal signal in technical analysis. As depicted in the chart, the price has been compressing within the wedge, gradually forming higher lows and now attempting a breakout from the resistance trendline. The recent green candles and growing volume suggest bulls are taking control, setting the stage for an upside move. With momentum building, traders could be looking at a potential 40% to 50% surge if the breakout sustains.

Conflux (CFX) has been gaining attention due to its unique position as a high-throughput, scalable blockchain that facilitates cross-border data and value transfer, particularly between China and the global crypto community. As regulatory clarity improves and Conflux continues to expand its ecosystem through partnerships and integrations, market sentiment has shifted in favor of the project. This renewed investor confidence is visible in the technical structure forming on the CFXUSDT chart, as smart money begins to accumulate.

The breakout target aligns with a previous high, indicating that this could be more than just a short-term rally. If volume continues to support the price action, CFX could rally toward the $0.12–$0.13 zone, which marks a critical resistance area. This creates a favorable risk-reward environment for both swing traders and position holders eyeing medium-term gains. Technical traders should watch for confirmation above the wedge and continuation candles backed by volume to validate the move.

Overall, CFXUSDT looks primed for a strong upward movement, supported by bullish technicals and increasing investor interest in the Conflux network. As the project remains fundamentally strong and gains traction in the Web3 space, this may be an opportunity to capitalize on a promising mid-cap altcoin.

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, GPSUSDT Forming Bullish Impluse leg, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GPSUSDT/G6BIEGvH-GPSUSDT-Forming-Bullish-Impluse-leg/, GPSUSDT has recently shown a bullish continuation setup after forming a strong impulse leg, followed by a textbook falling channel—typically a bullish flag pattern. This price structure is often seen in trending markets as a consolidation phase before the next leg up. With the current breakout attempt supported by rising volume, technical indicators suggest that the market is preparing for a potential surge. A breakout from this falling channel could initiate a powerful bullish wave, targeting gains of 50% to 60% or more.

The growing interest from investors further validates the current technical outlook. GPS is drawing attention in the altcoin space as market participants begin positioning ahead of potential announcements or development milestones. The improving sentiment around mid-cap altcoins is also contributing to a rotation of capital into undervalued projects like GPS, which are now showing early signs of momentum. Price action traders and swing traders should monitor this breakout closely, as the risk-to-reward setup appears highly favorable at these levels.

From a market structure perspective, this breakout may push GPSUSDT toward the $0.036–$0.038 resistance range, which aligns with the height of the previous impulse leg. If buyers sustain pressure and trading volume continues to build, the coin could even outperform the projected move, making this setup one of the more attractive technical plays on the daily chart. This aligns well with broader altcoin market cycles, where coins that consolidate after an initial push often deliver extended rallies once accumulation completes.

With a strong bullish flag formation, solid volume backing, and clear investor interest, GPSUSDT is well-positioned for a sharp upward move. This could present a timely opportunity for both short- and medium-term traders looking to capitalize on a technical breakout in an emerging project.

What follows a correction is a bullish impulse.

A target of $81 gives us more than 1,450% profits potential for this pair, ICPUSDT (Internet Computer Protocol).

This is a project that was damaged by the SEC's decision to label it a security, remember? The SEC today is no longer the same as back in those days. It is different now. The SEC is crypto-bullish, the SEC is friendly and whatever damage was caused will be reversed, make no mistake.

Right now ICP is moving within it's long-term accumulation zone. As the name implies, a zone that is good to buy for those focused on long-term hold. Even if you are looking at the short-term or mid-term, this right now is a great entry, great timing, the best possible prices preceding the 2025 bull market phase.

It was a while back when I first saw the possibility of the bull market extending beyond late 2025. This scenario/possibility is now becoming stronger with many projects supporting this view. The chart of many stable, long-term projects are pointing to growth leading into the first half of 2026. Q1 and Q2 2026. This would definitely be the best ever.

Will the next bull market peak in late 2025 or early 2026? Make your guess. What cannot be doubted is that we are going up next. Up, up, up. Are you prepared?

Preparation comes in the form of a plan, and lots of money injected into the market.  Buy like the world is about to end. Start buying and continued buying, everything you can. You will be very happy with the results, I promise. 

Thank you for reading.

📅 Date: June 8, 2025
💱 Pair: BTC/USD (BITSTAMP)
📊 Indicator: Awesome Oscillator (AO)

🧠 Technical Analysis Summary:
A classic 5-wave Elliott structure (1–2–3–4–5) has completed. Key observations:

Wave (5) slightly pushes above Wave (3), but momentum weakens.

Bearish divergence is spotted on the Awesome Oscillator (AO) between Wave (3) and Wave (5), signaling exhaustion.

Price is currently holding above a key structure support (SNR) at 105415.

🔻 Sell Setup:
🟥 SNR = Structure level at 105415.

🧨 If price breaks below 105415, I will enter a short (sell) position.

🧠 This level acts as a confluence zone:

End of wave 5

Loss of bullish momentum

Bearish AO divergence

Potential trend shift

📌 Trade Plan:
💥 Action:
➡️ Sell only if price breaks and closes below 105415.

🎯 Potential Targets:

104200 – local structure support

102800 – deeper correction zone (possible wave A)

🛡️ Invalidation:
➡️ If price closes back above recent high (~105800) with renewed AO strength, I’ll reconsider the short.

🧰 Tools Used:
Elliott Wave Theory (1–5 structure)

Awesome Oscillator – Divergence Confirmation

Market Structure (SNR as key support)

💬 Conclusion:
Wave 5 is done. Momentum has faded. All eyes on the structure level at 105415.

Watch These Zones Closely!, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/jh2koKXk-BTC-Key-Rejection-or-Breakout-Watch-These-Zones-Closely/, Hey fam! 👋 Here’s a clean 4H BTC setup with two key scenarios playing out – and both are packed with juicy liquidity zones and price action signals. Let’s break it down 👇

⚪ White Scenario (Bullish Bias):
1. BTC breaks above 107k – a strong breakout structure.
2. Expect a potential continuation move towards 109k, even eyeing the Premium Zone near 110k–111k if momentum holds.
3. Would confirm bullish intent and sweep weak highs.

🟡 Yellow Scenario (Bearish Bias):
1. BTC got rejected around 106k.
2. If it fails to reclaim 107k, expect a potential move back below 100k, especially if we see another CHoCH confirmation.
3. Watch for price to dive into the liquidity void near 98k, possibly deeper into the PMZ (Premium/Discount Equilibrium) zone.
4. Strong confluence at that Sell-side liquidity zone.

🧠 Key Market Structures:
1. Multiple CHoCHs and BOS visible – price is showing indecision.
2. Equal Highs (EQH) & Equal Lows (EQL) hint at liquidity grabs.
3. Liquidity Voids marked are critical for entries or exits.

📍No bias here, just trade the reaction.
Whether bulls or bears win this round, both scenarios offer clear entry/exit zones if you’re patient and follow structure. 📈📉

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, AVAXUSDT Forming Bullish reversals, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AVAXUSDT/8e16p5zO-AVAXUSDT-Forming-Bullish-reversals/, AVAXUSDT is currently positioned at a major demand zone that has acted as strong support multiple times in the past. This area between $17 and $20 has historically triggered bullish reversals, and recent price action shows a potential bottoming pattern forming within this zone. The market has responded positively with a slight uptick in volume, indicating renewed buying interest from both retail and institutional investors. This setup could be the beginning of a sharp bullish rally, especially if the price holds above the support and breaks the near-term resistance levels.

Avalanche (AVAX) continues to attract investor attention due to its rapidly growing ecosystem and increasing adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 projects. As blockchain infrastructure becomes more critical, AVAX stands out with its high throughput and low-cost transactions, making it a competitive choice for developers and users. The network has seen consistent upgrades and ecosystem expansion, which boosts long-term investor confidence. From a technical standpoint, the current structure resembles a classic accumulation range with a breakout potential pointing toward a 90% to 100% gain in the coming weeks.

If AVAX can reclaim and hold above the $22–$23 level, it would likely trigger a strong impulsive move toward the $42–$45 target range. The risk-reward ratio remains highly favorable for swing traders and position traders aiming to capitalize on this potential reversal. The expected upside is clearly illustrated on the chart, and with broader market sentiment slowly shifting bullish again, AVAX could be one of the top performers in this cycle.

With confluence from strong technical support, solid fundamentals, and increasing investor interest, AVAXUSDT is setting up for what could be a major bullish leg. Traders should keep a close eye on breakout confirmation and volume expansion for entry signals.

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, EURUSD MOVE IN 2ND WEEK, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/z4U4gw7Q-EURUSD-MOVE-IN-2ND-WEEK/, 🔍 Preliminary Technical Analysis:

1. Short-term Trend: The pair appears to be undergoing a corrective move downward after a clear upward trend from around 1.1200 to above 1.1500.

2. Nearby Resistance: Located in the 1.1450 to 1.1500 area.

3. Nearby Support: The 1.1350 level is acting as a potential support; breaking below it may push the price toward 1.1300 or even 1.1250.

4. Price Pattern: There's a possibility of a double top formation or a corrective ABC pattern.

🧠 Likely Scenario (Not Guaranteed):

If the price continues to move below 1.1450 and fails to form higher highs, we might see a further drop toward:

Target 1: 1.1350
Target 2: 1.1300

However, if the price breaks above the 1.1450 area and holds, an upward move toward 1.1500 and possibly 1.1550 could occur.

🛠️ Recommendations:

Watch how the price behaves around 1.1350: Is there a reversal candle pattern or a strong breakout?
Use supporting indicators like RSI or MACD to confirm momentum.
Avoid entering trades without confirmation from candlestick patterns or breakouts., 2025-06-08 06:32:24+00:00, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/z4U4gw7Q-EURUSD-MOVE-IN-2ND-WEEK/,

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, RVNUSDT Forming Bullish Reversals, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RVNUSDT/lFvY6MTk-RVNUSDT-Forming-Bullish-Reversals/, RVNUSDT is currently showing a promising technical setup after an extended period of consolidation. The price has formed a strong base, supported by steady volume growth, which indicates renewed interest from both retail and institutional traders. This consolidation phase appears to be nearing completion, and a breakout from this level could trigger a powerful bullish rally. Based on the current structure and market momentum, a 70% to 80% gain is anticipated in the upcoming weeks.

Ravencoin (RVN) has maintained relevance in the blockchain space due to its unique focus on asset tokenization. It enables the creation and transfer of real-world assets on the blockchain, which is a growing narrative in the Web3 and DeFi sectors. As more investors seek alternative platforms to tokenize assets and explore decentralized finance, RVN is positioned to benefit from the increased use case demand and adoption.

Technically, RVNUSDT has respected key support zones, and the price action suggests accumulation by long-term holders. A confirmed breakout above recent resistance could catalyze the start of a bullish wave, with price targets aligning around historical resistance levels. The volume uptick further validates the possibility of a breakout, hinting at increased buyer activity and confidence in the project’s future.

Overall, RVNUSDT presents a compelling risk-reward setup for traders and investors watching altcoins with real utility and strong community backing. With the chart structure, fundamentals, and volume all aligning, this crypto pair could be preparing for a significant upward movement.

DYRO, NFA, 2025-06-08 06:43:56+00:00, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RWAUSDT/UJSfXeM3-RWAUSDT-1D-Chart/, 
https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, Litecoin —It's All In Your Mind, Time To Decide, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCUSDT/RpX9y8kg-Litecoin-It-s-All-In-Your-Mind-Time-To-Decide/, Truly the longest consolidation phase has been experienced, since June 2022 until June 2025. This consolidation produced a broad channel for Litecoin but, make no mistake, this is a trading range.

The difference between a rising channel where consolidation is happening and a very strong bull market is the slope of the rise. The bull market price action produces a much stronger rise, as shown by the bars pattern.

The action becomes more erratic to the upside rather than stable and sideways. The market becomes euphoric because people cannot handle all the money they hold. Your account balance grows and grows and grows, so much that you lose all control. So much that you forget it, so much that you don't take action and then everything is gone.

It is incredible but still, many people do take advantage and those are mainly the ones with experience.

The first time we get it wrong. That's ok, we've all been there, nobody to blame rookie mistake.

The second time we do better but we still feel we could have done even better. If only we had more organization, more time to prepare; more experience...

The third time... This is the third time.

Thousands of millionaires are created in each bull market, tends of thousands, are you going to be one of those?

There is no competition. For you to make money nobody else has to lose money it doesn't work that way. It is different; the market gives, the market takes.

If you are ready to accept a lot the market will give you a lot.
If you are here to lose money the market will take everything away.

It is not about the whales, the bots or the exchange... It is all about you, it is all in your mind.

Some people join the last few days and make millions by buying big and selling right away, over and over. Some people lose millions by going LONG going SHORT when the market is neither going down or up. Some people are playing games.

You just need to decide, consciously and unconsciously what is your true goal. If you want financial independence, financial abundance, financial freedom, just make your choice. Say it, write it, see it, feel it... Believe it, and everything you want will be yours.

There is no limit other than your own mind.
The market will give you whatever you are ready to accept.

If you work for 10 millions dollars, that's exactly what you will get. But, if you work for 100 millions, hundreds you will get. There is no limit. It is all in your mind.

https://www.tradingview.com/feed/, AXLUSDT Forming Descending Wedge bullish, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AXLUSDT/gVMZZ2ra-AXLUSDT-Forming-Descending-Wedge-bullish/, AXLUSDT is currently showing strong bullish signals after consolidating at a significant support level, with a notable uptick in trading volume. This renewed volume interest often precedes a breakout move, and the technical structure is shaping up for a potential surge. With momentum building and price action tightening, a projected gain of 60% to 70% is realistically within reach in the short to mid-term. This aligns well with historical price behavior and upcoming support-to-resistance flips.

Axelar (AXL) continues to attract investor interest due to its foundational role in cross-chain communication and interoperability. As more blockchains develop in silos, the need for protocols like Axelar grows. Its ability to facilitate seamless transfers across multiple chains makes it a strong contender in the next wave of infrastructure-focused crypto projects. Market participants are increasingly positioning themselves in utility-driven tokens like AXL that solve real scalability and connectivity problems in DeFi and the broader crypto ecosystem.

From a technical perspective, AXLUSDT is forming a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting that the recent consolidation is simply a pause before another impulsive leg to the upside. The presence of strong support zones, combined with increased volume and investor sentiment, makes this a high-probability setup for breakout traders and swing investors alike. If bullish momentum continues, the upside targets fall well within the 60% to 70% projected gain range.

Traders should keep a close watch on breakout confirmation signals and volume spikes, which could mark the start of a sustained bullish rally. As adoption and attention around cross-chain solutions grow, AXL is likely to see further market traction and price appreciation.
